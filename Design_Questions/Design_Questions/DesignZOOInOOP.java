/*
 * How to design a zoo in oop? Some basic ideas are to have an abstract Animal class and have birds,
 *  mammal extend from it.
 *  Also have a class called Cages with different size.
 *  Zoo will contain a list of animal, list of cages, probably some workers. 
 *  What else should I add and how could we improve the design? Thanks.
 *  
 *  
 *  Different behaviors of animals like walkable, flyable can be interface which can allow you define/implement behaviors for different animals.

//cost, owner, lastSoldDate and methods like sell, changeOwner, calculateTax. If you work on game then your Zoo will have animals, trees and so on.
//Clear context allows you to decide what is important for your object and what's not.
//Strategy design pattern

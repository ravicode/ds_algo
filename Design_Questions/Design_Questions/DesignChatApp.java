The interviewer asked me to design the database of a chat application similar to whatsapp. 
I did it and said what if some intruder access the database, then I said I will apply md5 
encryption on phone numbers, then he asked me how md5 works. Why only md5? He asked me what are 
		Man in the middle attacks and asked me to remove man in middle attacks from the message
		transfers. He was impressed. 
He then asked me what is cache, why are cache fast and how it differs from RAM and hard disk 
architecturally.

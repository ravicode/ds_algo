/*
 * A simple crossroad can have traffic moving in 8 possible combinations: 
1. Curve paths: East->North, North->West, West->South and South->East (first is the inital direction of motion and second is 
the direction after making a curve). 
2. Straight path: All four directions. 

Out of this two can happen at the same time: 
ex: North->West and South->East and also in heading east and heading west can flow at the same time. 

Thus out of eight combinations we have to decide only among 4 combinations, this is similar to a 2 bit problem where the state 
can revolve around four possible states: 
00 
01 
10 
11

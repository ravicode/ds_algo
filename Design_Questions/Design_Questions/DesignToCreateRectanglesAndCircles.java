Then he gave me a class design. He went on changing his requirements and 
I was asked to add support for them in my implementation.
 At first, his requirement was to draw
a rectangle and a circle. 
Then he went on adding requirements and finally it was to draw different
specializations (like curved-edges, skewed-edges, dashed-lines) of rectangles, 
triangles 
and circle. He gave a constraint that support for a new specialization can be added easily 
in my design.

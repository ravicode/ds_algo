/*Our chef has recently opened a new restaurant with a unique style. 
The restaurant is divided into K compartments (numbered from 1 to K) and each 
compartment can be occupied by at most one customer. Each customer that visits 
the restaurant has a strongly preferred compartment p (1 ? p ? K), and if that 
compartment is already occupied, then the customer simply leaves. Now obviously, 
the chef wants to maximize the total number of customers that dine at his restaurant 
and so he allows (or disallows) certain customers so as to achieve this task.
You are to help him with this. Given a list of N customers with their arrival time, 
departure time and the preferred compartment, you need to calculate the maximum number
of customers that can dine at the restaurant.

Instead of restaurant and customers, I was given platforms and trains.

I was asked to design a data structure for that.*/

given two arrays in sorted form. 
The first array has some empty space equal to the size
of second array at its end. You have to merge both array in the smartest possible way in the 
first array. With constraint that auxiliary space O(1).

Ex ï¿½ arr1[9] = {2,4,5,7,8,_,_,_,_};
arr2[4] = {3,6,8,9};
after merging arr1 should be = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9};

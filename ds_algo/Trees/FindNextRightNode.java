/*Find next right node of a given keyGiven a Binary tree and a key in the binary tree,
 *  find the node right to the given key. If there is no node on right side, then return NULL. Expected time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the given binary tree.

For example, consider the following Binary Tree. Output for 2 is 6, output for 4 is 5.
 Output for 10, 6 and 5 is NULL. 

                  10
               /      \
	      2         6
           /   \         \ 
	 8      4          5

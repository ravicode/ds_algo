 * For implementing a dictionary which data structure you will use..???
 I answered I�ll use Trie .
 He spelled �T��R� �E� �E��
 Then I said no sir �T� �R� �I� �E��
 I explained with structure of trie how it is useful, beneficial and efficient.
 He told me to implement it in Tree.

 And asked me to remove it..
 I loop is not possible in a BST.
 He asked me to proof it�and I proved.

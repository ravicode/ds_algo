/*
 Only 5 were selected.I was asked only one question and i didnt do well. 
 Find the square root of a number. i answered that this can be done using Babylonian method. 
 (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/square-root-of-a-perfect-square/) or binary search method.. 
 He asked me to implement Binary Search method. I did a mistake. 
 then he asked me to correct it.. i corrected it.
 I wasnï¿½t able to impress him much.

He gave me task scheduling problem:
Given a set of modules, some modules depend on previous modules and can only be executed,
 if the requirements of that module is complete. 

Eg: module A depends on module B,C 
   module B depends on module C and D
   module C depends on E
   module E depends on D
   module D doesn't depend on any other module so he asked me to give a schedule for above modules 
   such that when a module is executed then all requirements of that module are complete.
so answer would be D E C B A

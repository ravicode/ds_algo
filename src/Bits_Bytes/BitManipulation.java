/*
 * (Bit manipulation/bit masking)
Given a M*N size tv screen. Colour of each pixel is integer value b/w 0-7 (i.e. 3 bits to represent colour)
screen is tightly packed bits(no byte padding allowed). now given a (i,j) index of pixel change its colour ?
Basically screen is matrix but in memory its represented as 1-d array.
character array can be used to represent each bit.
Hint:
map matrix (i,j) to 1-d array and change 3 bits to change colour.
problem arise when 2 bits are in one byte and another 1 bit is in another byte.

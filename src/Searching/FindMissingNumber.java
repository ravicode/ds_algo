 * /*
 * )There are two arrays. One contains n digits and the other n-1 digits. How to find the missing digit in the second array?
I asked the interviewer if I can assume that the elements are unique. He said yes. 
Then I solved it using XOR method. He asked what if the nos are negative or fration. 
I said that as two negative numbers or 2 decimal numbers will be stored in the same way
 in memory 
therefore XOR will work for that cases as well.

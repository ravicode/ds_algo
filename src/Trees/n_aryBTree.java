/*
Given a very large n-ary tree. Where the root node has some information which it wants
 to pass to all of its children down to the leaves with the constraint that it can only 
pass the information to one of its children at a time (take it as one iteration).
Now in the next iteration the child node can transfer that information to only one of 
its children and at the same time instance the childï¿½s parent i.e. root can pass the
 info to one of its remaining children. Continuing in this way we have to find the 
minimum no of iterations required to pass
the information to all nodes in the tree.

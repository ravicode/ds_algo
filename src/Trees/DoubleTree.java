/*Write a program that converts a given tree to its Double tree. 
To create Double tree of the given tree, create a new duplicate for 
each node, and insert the duplicate as the left child of the original
node. */

Algorithm:
Recursively convert the tree to double tree in postorder fashion.
For each node, first convert the left subtree of the node, 
then right subtree, finally create a duplicate node of the node 
and fix the left child of the node and left child of left child.*/

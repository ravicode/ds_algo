 * Then he gave me a problem which I had to implement in C.
 * The problem goes like this- There is an application which is again 
 * and again fetching data from database and then using that information 
 * in further processing,but since the application is again and again 
 * accessing the same database so inorder to increase the speed of 
 * accessing data we have to implement a cache.
 * (Property of cache-keep the most frequently used data and remove the
 *  least frequently used data if cache is full,assume limited size of
 *   cache).
 Solution that I first gave was using a linklist 
 (wrote all functions inC)
 He was happy with the solution but wanted me to
 think about more efficient solution so
 I told him using Heap and Hashing,implemented it in C again.
 He was impressed by this solution ï¿½:)

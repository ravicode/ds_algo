my favorite sorting algorithm. My favorite is insertion sort but I told him merge sort because
I knew a lot about merge sort so I wanted to drive the interview towards merge sort and as 
expected he asked many questions on merge sort and I gave him all the answers.
He asked me to build a tree from given preorder and postorder traversal of tree, I said it
is impossible to build from only these 2 traversals , you have to give me inorder to build 
a unique tree.

/*The interviewer asked me to pick up a project from all those I had worked on. 
 * I chose my B.Tech project related to Genetic Algorithm and Graphs 
Explain the algorithm 
How are graphs being represented in your project 
Various ways to represent adjacency nodes (adjacency matrix, adjacency list) 
Write code for adjacency list 
Write code for reversal of linked list (iterative and recursive) 
Which one would you prefer, arrays or linkedlist, if so why! 
Why use double pointers to pass head of a linked list, why can�t we just return
 the value from the function. Which one do you prefer and why.
(As I had done my code using double pointers.) 
What is a stack and heap, and how is memory allocated 
Given a step function f(i) whose value increases just once 
 we move from i = 1 .. infinity,
Find the value of i, where the transition occurs.
(I suggested increasing the length for checking by a power of 2, 
and then when a transition occurs, do a binary search within the boundary.) 
Why increase the length in powers of 2 and not just increase it by a constant 
factor of some value �n�

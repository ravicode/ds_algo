 * i) What is the running time for insertion, deletion, extracting min from a minHeap.
ii) What is the running time for insertion, deletion and searching an element in a sorted array and the same for an unsorted array?
iii) How would you determine if a coin is biased or not. Does the degree of biasity effect the number of experiments you have to perform?

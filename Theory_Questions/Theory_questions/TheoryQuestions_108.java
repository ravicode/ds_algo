4.1 He asked me about complexity . I told him about O(logn) and O(1) .
4.2 Then he asked me about how do you get O(1). I told him my approach . He said how will
 you rehash it when required . I told him that i will use extra memory and copy the hash map .
  Then i Optimized and did it in-place using a Boolean field.
4.3 Then he took this question to OS and asked me to do it using threads .

Then after a lot of discussion he was satisfied .

5) Some questions about Complexity of a algorithm . 
Asked me to prove complexity of few sample codes .

6) Some questions about storage space of a variable( data segment , stack , heap , BSS ).
 Some questions about Macro preprocessors and there problems & solutions .

7) Some questions about error in sample code given
 (like returning non compatible pointer type or returning address of a local variable etc )

8) In DOS and Linux shell when we press the up arrow we get the recently used commands .
 He asked me to implement this facility. 
 Then he asked me to do it if memory bound was very tight .

9) This was a question to check my analytic skills . 
We have customers using www.amazon.in for buying phones.
 Let say we have a user who visits www.amazon.in for buying mobile phone . 
 He selects a mobile then fills his address details and then when he finally goes

 * 
 * A web application is running. We have only a text box. If we enter a name in 
 * the text box, we get the details of the person whose name is entered. 
 * Now the question is to troubleshoot the application when it stopped displaying the
 *  results
 *  after entering a name( whose details are present in the data base).
 I answered many points here, like server is disconnected and there may be locks on 
 the details such that only one user can access the data at a time. And many 
 other, but he was not much satisfied.
